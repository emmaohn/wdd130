      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I want to send a message people with a passion for fashion, but may not 
        have the means to support the growth of a conventional wardrobe. I want 
        to contribute to a change in the view that fashion has to be new or luxury. 
        Second hand fashion is a great way to express yourself, give life to an old 
        piece of clothing, and subsequently reduce the environmental impact of 
        discarded clothing. Did you know that the amount of textile waste created 
        annually is an estimated 92 million tons? By inspiring fashion-oriented 
        individuals to pursue this kind of reuse, the emotional and environmental 
        effects abound. I would love to create a blog where there is a community 
        that is passionate about second hand fashion, and a community that cares 
        about the world we live in, even if it is a residual idea from becoming 
        more involved in the second hand community.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        I want to market towards college age, teens to young adults. I want to 
        reach people who are just beginning to understand and know who they really
        are, and are can share in the feeling of becoming an adult. I want to connect
        with a population of people who care.
