    <p>Howdy howdy! My name is Emma, but I go by Jojo, or as you might have also seen, Joe! 
    This is my fourth semester (second on campus),
    I'm a software engineering major with an emphasis in Web development, but it 
    took me a while to get there! I started as an applied math major and took a 
    programming class for my degree path and just fell in love with it, and now I'm 
    here!</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include scrapbooking, music, light reading, and of course
    the classic video games, even though I'm fairly new into playing them regularly, 
    they've always been a huge part of my life and somehow, I know more about the 
    functionality for the player of the game than I do about actually playing the 
    games myself, haha. I just recently started playing skyrim again, but before that
    I was playing tons and tons of Fortnite. I'm a big fan of the far cry series, and
    I feel like I know a ton about any fromsoft games and I'm about to play Dark Souls 
    III for the first time so I can finally master the ultimate gamer techniques.</p>
    <p>When I go back home to Texas, I have a job at Costa Vida in Fort Worth, but 
    I'm excited to start my career outside of food service! I've just recently come 
    across a web development class even though I've dabbled in HTML, but I really like 
    the idea of being able to make a difference or connect people all over the world 
    through a career or passion in web development. I've been a member of the church 
    since I was born, and a scriptures that has stuck with me is John 14:27 which says,
    "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I 
    unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."</p>
    <p>Nice to meet you all, Let's have a great semester!</p>
    <P>~Joe</P>
